## About
> This website is dedicated to analyzing attrition using IBM's synthetic data. We carried out three main processes: Objective, Analysis, and Conclusion.


## Objective

To identify the factors contributing to attrition and the most critical issues to address to retain employees.

## Analysis

For the analysis phase, we focused on three key factors: Environment Satisfaction, Job Satisfaction, and Work Life Balance. All visualizations were created using `Flourish` and `DataWrapper` for interactive charts and visualizations to illustrate key findings and patterns within the data. We have suggested scope of improvement on each analysis levels.

- `Environment Satisfaction` : Visualizing the distribution of environment satisfaction levels among employees.
- `Job Satisfaction` : Exploring the correlation between job satisfaction and attrition rates.
- `Work Life Balance` : Analyzing the impact of work-life balance on employee retention.

## Conclusion

By leveraging visualization techniques, we have identified several insights regarding attrition within the organization. These insights can serve as valuable inputs for management to implement targeted strategies aimed at improving employee satisfaction and reducing attrition rates.
